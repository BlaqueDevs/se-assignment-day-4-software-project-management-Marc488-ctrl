Structure: Waterfall methodology provides a structured approach to project management, with each phase building upon the previous one. This helps to reduce the risk of project failure and ensures that all aspects of the project are thoroughly planned and executed.
Predictability: Waterfall methodology offers a high degree of predictability, as each phase is completed before moving on to the next. This makes it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a fixed timeline.
Disadvantages:
Rigidity: Waterfall methodology can be rigid and inflexible, making it difficult to accommodate changes or new requirements. This can result in a product that does not meet’s evolving needs.
Limited customer involvement: Waterfall methodology involves limited customer involvement, which can lead to a product that does not fully meet the customer’s expectations.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each? 
Agile and Waterfall are two popular software development methodologies. Agile is more beneficial in projects that require frequent changes, have a high degree of uncertainty, or have a short development cycle. On the other hand, Waterfall is more suitable for projects with a well-defined scope, a low degree of uncertainty, and a long development cycle.
Here are some examples of each:
Agile:
Developing a mobile app for a startup company with frequent updates and changing requirements.
Creating a software application for a customer with a high degree of uncertainty in their needs and requirements.
Waterfall:
Developing a complex software system for a large corporation with a well-defined scope and a long development cycle.
Creating a custom database system for a client with a low degree of uncertainty in their requirements and a long development cycle.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?  
There are several methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project, including:
